**A SocialFi Clan War Game Built on Lens Protocol**

Clash of Lens transforms the Lens Protocol into a real-time battleground where **Lens Groups become Clans**, and **onchain social activity becomes strategy**. It’s the first-ever PvP game on Lens where tipping, followers, posts, and NFT collects determine victory — not chance.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Create or Join a Clan**  
   Clans are Lens Groups. Users form teams and represent their collective identity.

2. **Declare War**  
   Clan leaders trigger a `startWar()` PostAction. Wars run for a fixed time (e.g., 7 days).

3. **Compete in Real Metrics**  
   All war activity is tracked via a custom subgraph:
   - 💰 GHO tips
   - 🖼 NFT collects
   - 👥 Follower growth
   - 📝 Post activity

4. **Predictions Markets are posted**
 Fans can engage with the market and bet on their fav clan. ( Custom Post Action ) 

5. **Declare the Winner**  
   At the end of the war, `declareWinner()` is called via PostAction. Metrics are resolved, and rewards are distributed onchain.

6. **Earn Rewards**  
   - 🏆 Winning Clan: GHO Pool, Victory Emblem NFTs  
   - ✨ MVP Player: Gold Medal NFT  
   - 🌈 Members: Graph Aura profile badge
